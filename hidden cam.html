<p>In recent events of attacks on minorities in various nations. Many news outlets have shown that the authorities were also involved. In Delhi recently many police officials were suspected breaking security cams and destroying public property. People think this but I say they could be goons masquerading as police. Whatsoever when someone pays for security in security cameras it must be given to them. Besides in order to protect faith in authorities we provide a solution in terms of hidden cameras along with security cams. The number is the key here. We will not tell even homeowners how many were installed initially; only 2,3,4 which he paid for will be installed. For hidden Cams, price will be taken and number as well as location would not be disclosed until in time of need when home is attacked. When AI will activate them.</br>
The secrecy is only for protection of peoples. Most people disclose even their most personal things with closed once. And in most cases some closed one is responsible for problems, either by telling others or individually.</br>

AI is trained for certain disclosed situations.</p>
