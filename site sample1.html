<h2>Inroduction</h2>
<p>Neurological disorders are disorders of nervous system. Some disorders are common like bells palsy while others are  less common like Blephrospasm and spasmodic tortocolis. Common or not they cause huge deal of inconvience and suffuring. Especially, when they are related with the eye which is our primary sense to observe our surrounding. FOr example blephrospasm render a person visually disable due to uncontrolled eye closures, they can't even walk on stairs. While in Bell's palsy only one eye blink while other remain open and is somewhat paralysed which create a socially awkward situation due to which the patient generally hesitate to go to public places. Likewise spasmodic tortocolis cause paralysis to neck due to which it gets stuck to one side and person is unable to rotate it, due to which in order to look in front of him he has to turn his iris since he can't rotate his head. As we see all of these are very serious on part of patient their detection is extremly important.</p>
