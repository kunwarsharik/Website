<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p>The Aim of this device is to Keep Beverages on preset temperature using low-cost electronic equipment. The device aims to help lazy tea/cold drink drinkers keeping their drink at the temperature they want. 
</p>
<h2>What is your idea?</h2>
<p>The automatic temperature controlled mugs are being proposed by us. The user inputs the temperature on which he wants to keep the liquid or partially liquid/solid. By means of temperature sensors, it senses the present temperature.
<ol><li>If the temperature of the contained thing is equal to the input temperature, the heating and cooling units remain standby.</li>
<li>If the contained thing's temperature is less than the input temperature, the heating unit gets activated.  The heating unit increases the temperature to match the input temperature; therefore, maintaining contained thing on input temperature.
</li>
<li>If the temperature of the contained thing is more to the input temperature, the cooling unit gets activated. The cooling unit decreases the temperature to match the input temperature; therefore, maintaining contained thing on input temperature.</li>
</ol></br>
The device has its own dedicated battery system, and it can be charged to be used in mobile situations. If an electricity plug is available, it can be connected to it and directly used. It is better to be used unplugged.
</p>

<h2>Why is it useful?</h2>
<p>From the perspective of the owner(electricity consumer):</br>
<ol>
<li>Global warming has severely affected the earth. Now in cold places like Denmark itself, colds are colder, and in places like Dubai, summer is hotter. Generally, people spend there leisure time reading books or scrolling the internet while drinking coffee/tea or cold beverages. After some time, the food or drink turns hot to mild or cold to mild. Nobody likes that. In fact, it is frustrating when your drink change temperature without you drinking it. Moreover, we like to drink or eat food opposite to our environment like hot coffee in the winters and cold drinks in the summers.
</li>
<li>.Also, there are some chemicals, that need to be kept on certain temperatures; our innovation can also be used in such cases.</li>
<li>Only one device to cool and heat contained item make it more useful.
The user only needs to input the temperature he wants for his food. Therefore it is really user friendly and easy to use.
</li>
<li>Childrens burn their mouths drinking/eating hot food. Parents can set the temperature they want for childrens' foods.
</li>
<li>The same technology can be used to surface like car steering, car window puller, etc.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Has it been implemented before?</h2>
<p>Presently we have heat managing (referred to as temperature controlled) cooking utensils. These are used for cooking and are not for your dining table. Also, there is no mobility in these.  Even for heating, they are just a little bit of turning the heat on/off. We are implementing cooling and heating both and maintaining temperature, with totally new technology. So we can say such a project is never implemented before.
